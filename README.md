# Handwritten Digits Classifier using PyTorch
Udacity AWS ML Fundamentals Project 2

*Objective:* To prototype a system for optical character recognition (OCR) on handwritten digits.


*Description:* This project focused on designing and implementing a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. The task involved building and training a neural network that accurately identifies digits in grayscale images, with a target to achieve a high test accuracy.
